# bastion-alb-asg-ec2-vpc-setup
Itâ€™s a complete hands-on project where I designed a secure and scalable AWS infrastructure using a custom VPC. It includes public and private subnets, a bastion host for SSH access, an Application Load Balancer that routes traffic from port 80 to EC2s listening on port 8000, and an Auto Scaling Group for high availability.
